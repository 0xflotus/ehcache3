== Getting started with the new API

WARNING: *This is still work in progress*. while this represents the API as it exists today, the plan is to only close it
         down, when addressing the +OSS Beta+ milestone. Today, the focus is on the +107 Alpha+ milestone, which aims
         at providing a TCK compliant on-heap implementation...

<1> Static method +org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManagerBuilder+ that returns a new +org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder+
    instance;
<2> Using the builder to register a pre-configured +Cache+ to be create when we +.build()+ the actual +CacheManager+.
    The first +String+ argument is the alias to use to interact with the +Cache+ through the +CacheManager+; the second
    argument is the +org.ehcache.config.CacheConfiguration+ to use to configure the +Cache+. We use the static
    +.newCacheConfigurationBuilder()+ method on +org.ehcache.config.CacheConfigurationBuilder+ to create a default config;
<3> finally, invoking +.build()+ returns a fully instantiated and initialized +CacheManager+ we can use.
<4> We can retrieve the +preConfigured+ aliased +Cache+ we declared in step 2. For type-safety, we ask for both key and
    value types to be passed in. If these differ from the ones we expect, the +CacheManager+ throws a +ClassCastException+
    early in the application's lifecycle. It also guards the +Cache+ from being polluted by random types.
<5> The +CacheManager+ can also be used to create new +Cache+ as needed. Just as in step 2, it requires passing in an
    alias as well as a +CacheConfiguration+. The instantiated and fully initialized +Cache+ added will be returned and/or
    can be accessed through the +CacheManager.getCache+ API.
<6> We can now use the newly added +Cache+ to store and ...
<7> ... retrieve data.
<8> We can also +CacheManager.remove()+ a given +Cache+. The +CacheManager+ will not only remove it's reference to the
    +Cache+, but will also close it. The +Cache+ releases all locally held transient resources (such as memory).
    References held to this +Cache+ become unusable.
<9> A new feature of Ehcache 3.0, is the ability to create +StandaloneCache+ instances, i.e. ones not managed by a +CacheManager+;
<10> As there is nothing that manages them, it is up to you to +StandaloneCache.init()+ them, prior to using them.
<11> In order to release all transient resources (memory, threads, ...) a +CacheManager+ provides to +Cache+ instances
     it manages, you have to invoke +CacheManager.close()+, which in turns closes all +Cache+ instances known at the time.
<12> In the same vein, a +StandaloneCache+ requires you to +StandaloneCache.close()+ it explicitly. The +CacheManager.close()+
     in step #11, didn't affect our +StandaloneCache+ in any way.
