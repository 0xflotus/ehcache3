== Getting started with the new API

For samples, documentation, and usage information, please see http://ehcache.org.

== Current release

We released 3.1.4 on February 27th 2017.

The https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases/tag/v3.1.1[release notes] contain the links to the artifacts and the documentation to help you get started.

You should consider upgrading to 3.2.x as it does all 3.1.x does and more with a fully compatible API.

== Current development & next release

We are now working on the missing features of the clustering tier of Ehcache 3 which will be included in upcoming 3.x releases.
There will no longer be any release on the 3.1.x branch.

See the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones[milestones on GitHub] for more details on the current status.
