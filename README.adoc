== Current release

We released the Milestone 1 on March 24th 2015. In addition to the JSR-107 compatibility,
it introduces tiering and offers an offheap option based on the recently https://github.com/Terracotta-OSS/offheap-store[open sourced library] from Terracotta.

The https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/releases/tag/v3.0.0.Alpha[release notes] contain the links to the documentation
to help you get started

== Current development & next release

We are now working on the next milestone :
All the work to get all the features we want to port from the existing Ehcache 2.x line, exposed using the new API.
This includes things not covered by the 107 spec, such as _WriteBehind_, _EvictionListener_ et al.

See the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones[milestones on GitHub] for more details on the current status.
