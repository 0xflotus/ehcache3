== Getting started with the new API

WARNING: *This is still work in progress*. while this represents the API as it exists today, the plan is to only close it
         down, when addressing the +OSS Beta+ milestone. Today, the focus is on the +107 Alpha+ milestone, which aims
         at providing a TCK compliant on-heap implementation...

final CacheManager cacheManager
    = newCacheManagerBuilder() // <1>
    .withCache("preConfigured", newCacheConfigurationBuilder().buildCacheConfig(Long.class, String.class)) // <2>
    .build(); // <3>

final Cache<Long, String> preConfigured = cacheManager.getCache("preConfigured", Long.class, String.class); // <4>

final Cache<Long, String> myCache = cacheManager.createCache("myCache", // <5>
    newCacheConfigurationBuilder().buildCacheConfig(Long.class, String.class));

myCache.put(1L, "da one!"); // <6>
final String value = myCache.get(1L); // <7>

cacheManager.removeCache("preConfigured"); // <8>

final StandaloneCache<Long, String> standaloneCache = newCacheBuilder(Long.class, String.class)
    .build(); // <9>

<1> Static method +org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder.newCacheManagerBuilder+ that returns a new +org.ehcache.CacheManagerBuilder+
    instance;
<2> Using the builder to register a pre-configured +Cache+ to be create when we +.build()+ the actual +CacheManager+.
    The first +String+ argument is the alias to use to interact with the +Cache+ through the +CacheManager+; the second
    argument is the +org.ehcache.config.CacheConfiguration+ to use to configure the +Cache+. We use the static
    +.newCacheConfigurationBuilder()+ method on +org.ehcache.config.CacheConfigurationBuilder+ to create a default config;
<3> finally, invoking +.build()+ returns a fully instantiated and initialized +CacheManager+ we can use.
<4> We can retrieve the +preConfigured+ aliased +Cache+ we declared in step 2. For type-safety, we ask for both key and
    value types to be passed in. If these differ from the ones we expect, the +CacheManager+ throws a +ClassCastException+
    early in the application's lifecycle. It also guards the +Cache+ from being polluted by random types.
<5> The +CacheManager+ can also be used to create new +Cache+ as needed. Just as in step 2, it requires passing in an
    alias as well as a +CacheConfiguration+. The instantiated and fully initialized +Cache+ added will be returned and/or
    can be accessed through the +CacheManager.getCache+ API.
<6> We can now use the newly added +Cache+ to store and ...
<7> ... retrieve data.
<8> We can also +CacheManager.remove()+ a given +Cache+. The +CacheManager+ will not only remove it's reference to the
    +Cache+, but will also close it. The +Cache+ releases all locally held transient resources (such as memory).
    References held to this +Cache+ become unusable.
<9> A new feature of Ehcache 3.0, is the ability to create +StandaloneCache+ instances, i.e. ones not managed by a +CacheManager+;
<10> As there is nothing that manages them, it is up to you to +StandaloneCache.init()+ them, prior to using them.
<11> In order to release all transient resources (memory, threads, ...) a +CacheManager+ provides to +Cache+ instances
     it manages, you have to invoke +CacheManager.close()+, which in turns closes all +Cache+ instances known at the time.
<12> In the same vein, a +StandaloneCache+ requires you to +StandaloneCache.close()+ it explicitly. The +CacheManager.close()+
     in step #11, didn't affect our +StandaloneCache+ in any way.

== Current status & future development

We currently have two main milestones planned, probably work leading into early next year until we have a GA release available. But here's how we are splitting the work:

 * https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones/107%20Alpha[107 Alpha] (on going): This is all the work to get a
   https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JSR-107] compliant on-heap implementation of the new Ehcache 3.0 line. The idea
   being to lay the ground work for the future work, knowing we pass the TCK and maintain that set of test passing as we
   move forward in the next milestone. Even though the focus is on 107, we still want to have our decisions as we move
   along have the future work in mind.
 * https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones/OSS%20Beta[OSS Beta] (coming up next): All the work to get all the features we want to port from
   the existing Ehcache 2.x line, exposed using the new API. This includes things not covered by the 107 spec, such as
   _WriteBehind_, _DiskPersistence_, _EvictionListener_ et al.

Additional tasks, as they come up, would only be targeted to the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones/107%20Alpha[107 Alpha] milestone,
only if implementing it would mean not being able to pass the 107 TCK. Any other task gets assigned to
https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones/OSS%20Beta[OSS Beta].

See the https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3/milestones[milestones on github] for more details on the current status.
