=== +org.ehcache.Cache+ vs. +org.ehcache.spi.cache.Store+

Both those interfaces exist today. Yet what is each's concerns aren't well identified.

==== +Cache<K, V>+ backed by a +Store<K, Element<V>>+ ?

 . Rename +Element+ ?
 . +Store<K, Element<V>>+ vs. +Store<Element<K, V>>+ ?

==== Roles

How much can be solved by having the +Cache+ call into some +Store.process(K, EntryProcessor<K, V, T>): T+ equivalent?

 . +Cache+ Roles
 .. Store by Value vs. Ref.
 .. Expiry ?
 .. Cache lifecycle
 .. +BootstrapCacheLoader+
 .. CacheLoaders
 .. CacheWriters
 .. Listeners ?
.. Stats ?
 . +Store+ Roles
 .. Eviction
 .. Expiry ?
 .. Listeners ?
 .. Stats ?
